		<h1>About Me</h1>
		<p>
			I'm an exotic unique looking gal with wicked cool ideas. I'm always changing my look channelling my inner goddess and wanting to help encourage other women to do the same.
			All throughout any style of modelling we are doing the same thing but with different goals and different styles. it's a fun game of dress up for me. Not only do I model but I do stage performances of Bellydance and burlesque at events.
			I make my own lingerie, jewellery, and skincare which will be sold in my newly re-vamped shop on Etsy.
			I see myself as someone who inspires others to see their own inspiration.
			Muse, goddess, highly sought after and unattainable it's all apart of my appeal.
			I've been modelling collectively for two years and grown quite a bit. I shot pretty much any style and have no issues doing trade shoots.
